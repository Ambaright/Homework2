    "text": "Task 1: Basic Vector practice\nSuppose we have data from a medical experiment on blood pressure. We have the following pre-treatment values for subjects 1 through 20:\n• 120, 151, 125, 126, 115, 132, 132, 129, 134, 139, 127, 122, 127, 135, 133, 128, 147, 138, 140, 132\nafter treatment, the subjects were measured again (subjects 1 through 20 match)\n• 127, 145, 135, 122, 115, 122, 123, 126, 126, 129, 132, 146, 120, 114, 121, 120, 128, 120, 133, 115\n\nCreate two vectors. One corresponding to the pre measurements and one to the post measurements.\n\n\npre_measure &lt;- c(120, 151, 125, 126, 115, 132, 132, 129, 134, 139, 127, 122, 127, 135, 133, 128, 147, 138, 140, 132)\npost_measure &lt;- c(127, 145, 135, 122, 115, 122, 123, 126, 126, 129, 132, 146, 120, 114, 121, 120, 128, 120, 133, 115)\n\n\nAssign names to the vector elements using the paste() function. Note that names() can be overwritten by a character vector. To quickly create the names, try running the code\n\n\npaste(\"Subject\", 1:20, sep = \"_\")\n\n [1] \"Subject_1\"  \"Subject_2\"  \"Subject_3\"  \"Subject_4\"  \"Subject_5\" \n [6] \"Subject_6\"  \"Subject_7\"  \"Subject_8\"  \"Subject_9\"  \"Subject_10\"\n[11] \"Subject_11\" \"Subject_12\" \"Subject_13\" \"Subject_14\" \"Subject_15\"\n[16] \"Subject_16\" \"Subject_17\" \"Subject_18\" \"Subject_19\" \"Subject_20\"\n\n\nCreate the same names for each vector’s elements.\n\nnames(pre_measure) &lt;- paste(\"Subject\", 1:20, sep = \"_\")\nnames(post_measure) &lt;- paste(\"Subject\", 1:20, sep = \"_\")\n\n\nCalculate the change in blood pressure for each patient by subtracting post-treatment measurements from pre-treatment measurements. Recall that R does math element-wise! Save this calculation as a new object in R (also a vector)\n\n\npressure_change &lt;- pre_measure - post_measure\n\n\nCalculate the average decrease in blood pressure across all patients. Use the mean() function here!\n\n\nmean(pressure_change)\n\n[1] 5.65\n\n\n\nDetermine which patients experienced a decrease in blood pressure after treatment (a positive change). Use the which() function to just return the indices (and names) associated with this type of change.\n\n\nwhich(pressure_change &gt; 0)\n\n Subject_2  Subject_4  Subject_6  Subject_7  Subject_8  Subject_9 Subject_10 \n         2          4          6          7          8          9         10 \nSubject_13 Subject_14 Subject_15 Subject_16 Subject_17 Subject_18 Subject_19 \n        13         14         15         16         17         18         19 \nSubject_20 \n        20 \n\n\n\nSubset the vector of differences to only return those that have a positive change. (Note that you don’t need the which() function here. A Boolean used as an indexing vector returns only indices were a TRUE occurred.)\n\n\npressure_change[pressure_change &gt; 0]\n\n Subject_2  Subject_4  Subject_6  Subject_7  Subject_8  Subject_9 Subject_10 \n         6          4         10          9          3          8         10 \nSubject_13 Subject_14 Subject_15 Subject_16 Subject_17 Subject_18 Subject_19 \n         7         21         12          8         19         18          7 \nSubject_20 \n        17 \n\n\n\nCalculate the average decrease in blood pressure for those where the blood pressure decreased (positive change).\n\n\nmean(pressure_change[pressure_change &gt; 0])\n\n[1] 10.6\n\n\n\n\nTask 2: Basic Data Frame practice\n\nCreate a data frame object with four columns corresponding to your data above: patient, pre_bp, post_bp, and diff_bp\n\n\nbp_df &lt;- data.frame(patient = paste(\"Subject\", 1:20, sep = \"_\"), pre_bp = pre_measure, post_bp = post_measure, diff_bp = pressure_change)\n\n\nReturn only rows of the data frame where the diff_bp column is negative. (Use [ or learn about the subset() function if you’d like. If you use [, don’t reference the original vector from the first part, access the column of the data frame to make your comparison with 0.)\n\n\nsubset(bp_df, diff_bp &lt; 0)\n\n              patient pre_bp post_bp diff_bp\nSubject_1   Subject_1    120     127      -7\nSubject_3   Subject_3    125     135     -10\nSubject_11 Subject_11    127     132      -5\nSubject_12 Subject_12    122     146     -24\n\n\n\nAdd a new column to the data frame corresponding to TRUE if the post_bp is less than 120 and FALSE if it is not. Similar to the previous question, don’t reference the original vector from task 1, access the column of the data frame to make your comparison.\n\nRecall you can use $ to access a column. If you reference a column that doesn’t exist and save a vector (of appropriate length in it), that vector becomes a column of your data frame! Use this way of creating the new column.\n\nbp_df$post_bp_less_than_120 &lt;- bp_df[, 3] &lt; 120\n\n\nFinally, print the data frame out nicely in your final document by modifying the code below appropriately.\n\n\nknitr::kable(bp_df)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npatient\npre_bp\npost_bp\ndiff_bp\npost_bp_less_than_120\n\n\n\n\nSubject_1\nSubject_1\n120\n127\n-7\nFALSE\n\n\nSubject_2\nSubject_2\n151\n145\n6\nFALSE\n\n\nSubject_3\nSubject_3\n125\n135\n-10\nFALSE\n\n\nSubject_4\nSubject_4\n126\n122\n4\nFALSE\n\n\nSubject_5\nSubject_5\n115\n115\n0\nTRUE\n\n\nSubject_6\nSubject_6\n132\n122\n10\nFALSE\n\n\nSubject_7\nSubject_7\n132\n123\n9\nFALSE\n\n\nSubject_8\nSubject_8\n129\n126\n3\nFALSE\n\n\nSubject_9\nSubject_9\n134\n126\n8\nFALSE\n\n\nSubject_10\nSubject_10\n139\n129\n10\nFALSE\n\n\nSubject_11\nSubject_11\n127\n132\n-5\nFALSE\n\n\nSubject_12\nSubject_12\n122\n146\n-24\nFALSE\n\n\nSubject_13\nSubject_13\n127\n120\n7\nFALSE\n\n\nSubject_14\nSubject_14\n135\n114\n21\nTRUE\n\n\nSubject_15\nSubject_15\n133\n121\n12\nFALSE\n\n\nSubject_16\nSubject_16\n128\n120\n8\nFALSE\n\n\nSubject_17\nSubject_17\n147\n128\n19\nFALSE\n\n\nSubject_18\nSubject_18\n138\n120\n18\nFALSE\n\n\nSubject_19\nSubject_19\n140\n133\n7\nFALSE\n\n\nSubject_20\nSubject_20\n132\n115\n17\nTRUE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 3: List practice\nContinue the previous example. Suppose we now also have data from another experiment where the ‘treatment’ was actually a placebo.\nWe have the following pre-treatment values for subjects 1 through 10 (different set of subjects):\n• 138, 135, 147, 117, 152, 134, 114, 121, 131, 130\nafter treatment, the subjects were measured again (subjects 1 through 10 match)\n• 105, 136, 123, 130, 134, 143, 135, 139, 120, 124\n\nCreate a new data frame with this data in it that is similar to the data frame from task 2 (including the new column of TRUE/FALSE values).\n\n\npre_placebo &lt;- c(138, 135, 147, 117, 152, 134, 114, 121, 131, 130)\npost_placebo &lt;- c(105, 136, 123, 130, 134, 143, 135, 139, 120, 124)\ndiff_placebo &lt;- pre_placebo - post_placebo\n\n\nplacebo_df &lt;- data.frame(patient = paste(\"Subject\", 1:10, sep = \"_\"),\n                         pre_bp = pre_placebo, post_bp = post_placebo,\n                         diff_bp = diff_placebo)\nplacebo_df$post_bp_less_than_120 &lt;- placebo_df[,3] &lt;
